Intent - BATTERY

User: 
1.What is the battery life of an oximeter
2.When does the charge drain in an oximeter
3.Does oximeter battery run on low battery
4.How long does it take for the battery to run out in an oximeter
5.Oximeter not turning on***
6.Oximeter doesn't work***


Bot: A fully charged battery should operate for at least 6 hours. A battery should take no more than 10 hours to charge, and charging should be possible while using the oximeter. 
A display of residual charge and low battery alarms are essential when operating on battery power.

intent - BUTTON

User:
1.how to check the strength of the pulse on oximeter
2.how to see the strength of the pulse on oximeter
3.what does button on the oximeter indicate
4.how to use the button on the oximeter
5.what does button on the oximeter does

Bot: 
Tapping the button once gives four different viewing angles
Holding the button for two seconds gives profusion Index(PI) in orange colour which indicates the strength of your pulse.
After 10 seconds, the screen goes to default mode showing pulse reading

intent - CORRECTNESS

User:
1.Is an oximeter reliable
2.Is oximeter reading always correct.
3.Can an oximeter show wrong results
4.How accurate is the readings of a oximeter.
5. Is it possible to say that the measurements in an oximeter is trust-worthy. ***

Bot:
The oxygen level from a pulse oximeter is reasonably accurate. Most oximeters give a reading 2% over or 2% under what your saturation would be if obtained by an arterial blood gas.

Intent - READING 
Entity - Normal_reading

User:
1.what are average readings on oximeter
2.default readings of oximeter
3.Normal readings of oximeter


BOT:
Normal pulse oximeter readings for oxygen saturation usually range from 95 to 100 percent. 100%. I
A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute and it ranges from 100 to 180 for babies aged 2 or less.



User: 
1. What should i do when the reading is below normal?***
2. Procedure to follow when the display is not normal?***
3. how can i know that the measurements is not good?***
4.what are the Abnormal readings in an oximeter?
5.what are the Alerting measurements in an oximeter? 
6.When should I be worried about the readings?
7.When should I consult a doctor with the readings?

BOT:
If the oxygen saturation is 94% or lower, the patient is hypoxic and needs to be treated quickly. A saturation of less than 90% is a clinical emergency.
Consult your doctor if your resting heart rate is consistently above 100 beats a minute (tachycardia) or if you're not a trained athlete
and your resting heart rate is below 60 beats a minute (bradycardia) — especially if you have other signs or symptoms, such as fainting, dizziness or shortness of breath.
When the readings dip below the normal values, an alarm will go off, indicating your immediate attention.


Intent- Display

User:
1.what are the numbers on oximeter shows
2.what are the numbers on oximeter point out
3.what are measurements of oximeter
4.What does readings on the oximeter indicate?
5.What are the display elements
6.What does the graph indicate
7.What does %SpO2 mean?
8.what does bpmPR mean?
9.Where is the power shown?
10.What is displayed on a pulse oximeter screen?***


BOT:
Number in yellow digits indicate the level of oxygen saturated blood. Since the oximeter detects the saturation
peripherally on a finger, toe or ear, the result is recorded as the peripheral oxygen saturation, described as SpO2.
Green shows the pulse. Some oximeters display a
pulse waveform or indicator that illustrates the strength of the pulse being detected.
The batter power is diplayed on the top.

Intent - SETUP

User:
1.how to set up the oximeter
2.How to start the oximeter
3. I want to use the oximeter***
4. tell me how to use a oximeter***

BOT:
Turn the pulse oximeter on: it will go through internal calibration and checks. Once ready, wait for the device to power on and insert your finger into the scanner.
After 5 seconds, you will see the readings in the display.Once the unit has detected a good pulse, the oxygen saturation and pulse rate will be displayed.
If possible, avoid the arm being used for blood pressure monitoring as cuff inflation will interrupt
the pulse oximeter signal.
Remove any nail varnish. 
Always make sure the alarms are on.



Intent- USES

User:
1.what is the purpose of oximeter
2.Why is oximeter used
3.what are the uses of oximeter
4.what are the Reasons to use oximeter
5.What two things does a pulse oximeter measure?***
6.Why should i use oximeter?***

BOT:
For people with COPD, asthma, Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and other conditions, pulse oximetry is a technology used to measure the oxygen level in your blood and your heart rate.
A finger pulse oximeter is equipped with technology to rapidly detect changes in your blood oxygen level.

Intent - WORKING

User:
1.Can you please explain how oximeter works
2.tell how oximeter works
3.What is the working of oximeter?
4.How does oximeter works?


BOT:
During a pulse oximetry reading, a small clamp-like device is placed on a finger, earlobe, or toe. Small beams of light pass through the blood in the finger, measuring the amount of oxygen. 
It does this by measuring changes of light absorption in oxygenated or deoxygenated blood. This is a painless process.
The pulse oximeter will thus be able to tell you your oxygen saturation levels along with your heart rate.

Intent - Error

User:
1. What should i do if no signal is obtained?
2. My display is blank
3. There is no reading in the oximeter
4. Error in displaying readings
5. why is there no reading in the oximeter?
6. I can't see any readings in the oximeter. 

BOT:
Is the probe working and correctly positioned? Try another location. Does the patient have poor perfusion? 
Check for low cardiac output especially due to hypovolemia, cardiac problems or septic
shock. If hypotension is present, resuscitation of the patient is required immediately. The
signal will improve when the clinical condition of the patient improves. 
Check the temperature of the patient. If the patient or the limb is cold, gentle rubbing of
the digit or ear lobe may restore a signal.
If any of the above methods are not working, please respond "It still doesn't work"


Intent- Oxygen

User:
1.HOW MUCH OXYGEN DOES THE BLOOD CARRY?
2.What is the concentration of oxygen the blood carries?
3.What is the normal oxygen level the blood carries?


BOT: In a patient who is in good health, Each gram of haemoglobin combines with 1.34 ml of oxygen. 
Anaemic patients have lower levels of haemoglobin and are therefore unable to carry as much
oxygen in the blood at a haemoglobin concentration of less than 6g/dl

User:
1.WHAT IS OXYGEN SATURATION?
2.What is meant by oxygen saturation?
3.what does oxygen saturation mean?
4. Tell me about oxygen saturation


BOT:
Red blood cells contain haemoglobin. One molecule of haemoglobin can carry up to four molecules
of oxygen after which it is described as “saturated” with oxygen.100%. If the oxygen saturation is
94% or lower, the patient is hypoxic and needs to be treated quickly. A saturation of less than 90%
is a clinical emergency.



Intent - Alarm

USER:
1. WHAT DO THE ALARMS ON A PULSE OXIMETER TELL YOU?
2. An alarm went off.
3. There is an alarm ringing in the oximeter
4. why is an alarm ringing?
5. what does the alarm ringing specify?
6. There is sound coming from the oximeter.

BOT:
Alarms alert the anaesthetist to clinical problems. The following are the reasons an alarm might go off
Low saturation emergency (hypoxia) i.e. SpO2 <90%. 
No pulse detected
Low pulse rate
High pulse rate


Intent - Factors

User:
1. WHAT ARE THE FACTORS THAT INTERFERE WITH THE PULSE OXIMETER READING?
2. factors affecting the oximeter reading.
3. it still doesn't work.
4. interference with pulse oximeter.
5. 

BOT: 

bright light directly on the probe may affect the reading
Shivering – movement may make it difficult for the probe to pick up a signal
Vasoconstriction reduces blood flow to the peripheries. The oximeter may fail to detect a signal
if the patient is very cold and peripherally vasoconstricted.
Carbon monoxide poisoning may give a falsely high saturation reading.

Intent - oxygen

USER:

2. Oxygen Saturation is low.
3. The patient's oxygen saturation is considerably low
4. What are the questions to ask when the oxygen saturation is low?
5. points to considen with low oxgygen saturation.


BOT:

Whenever the patient has low oxygen saturations, administer high flow oxygen and consider
‘ABCDE’:
 A - airway clear?
 B - breathing adequately?
 C - circulation working normally?
 D - drugs causing a problem?
