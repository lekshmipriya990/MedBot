  utter_usage:
  - text: "For people with COPD, asthma, Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and other conditions, pulse oximetry is a technology used to measure the oxygen level in your blood and your heart rate.
           A finger pulse oximeter is equipped with technology to rapidly detect changes in your blood oxygen level."
  utter_working:
  - text: "During a pulse oximetry reading, a small clamp-like device is placed on a finger, earlobe, or toe. Small beams of light pass through the blood in the finger, measuring the amount of oxygen. 
It does this by measuring changes of light absorption in oxygenated or deoxygenated blood. This is a painless process.
The pulse oximeter will thus be able to tell you your oxygen saturation levels along with your heart rate."
  utter_battery:
  - text: "A fully charged battery should operate for at least 6 hours. A battery should take no more than 10 hours to charge, and charging should be possible while using the oximeter. 
A display of residual charge and low battery alarms are essential when operating on battery power."
#  utter_button:
#    - text: "Tapping the button once gives four different viewing angles
#  Holding the button for two seconds gives profusion Index(PI) in orange colour which indicates the strength of your pulse.
#  After 10 seconds, the screen goes to default mode showing pulse reading"
#    utter_abnormalreading:
#   - text: "If the oxygen saturation is 94% or lower, the patient is hypoxic and needs to be treated quickly. A saturation of less than 90% is a clinical emergency.
# Consult your doctor if your resting heart rate is consistently above 100 beats a minute (tachycardia) or if you're not a trained athlete
# and your resting heart rate is below 60 beats a minute (bradycardia) â€” especially if you have other signs or symptoms, such as fainting, dizziness or shortness of breath.
# When the readings dip below the normal values, an alarm will go off, indicating your immediate attention."
#    utter_normalreading:
#     - text: "Normal pulse oximeter readings for oxygen saturation usually range from 95 to 100 percent. 100%. I
# A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute and it ranges from 100 to 180 for babies aged 2 or less."
  utter_correctness:
    - text: "The oxygen level from a pulse oximeter is reasonably accurate. Most oximeters give a reading 2% over or 2% under what your saturation would be if obtained by an arterial blood gas."
  utter_setup:
    - text: "Turn the pulse oximeter on: it will go through internal calibration and checks. Once ready, wait for the device to power on and insert your finger into the scanner.
After 5 seconds, you will see the readings in the display.Once the unit has detected a good pulse, the oxygen saturation and pulse rate will be displayed.
If possible, avoid the arm being used for blood pressure monitoring as cuff inflation will interrupt
the pulse oximeter signal.
Remove any nail varnish. 
Always make sure the alarms are on."
  utter_display:
    - text: "Number in yellow digits indicate the level of oxygen saturated blood. Since the oximeter detects the saturation
peripherally on a finger, toe or ear, the result is recorded as the peripheral oxygen saturation, described as SpO2.
Green shows the pulse. Some oximeters display a
pulse waveform or indicator that illustrates the strength of the pulse being detected.
The batter power is diplayed on the top."
